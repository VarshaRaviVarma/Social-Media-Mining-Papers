# “THE BRIGHT AND DARK SIDE OF REDDIT”

## Research Question
Considering bright side and dark side as two categories, what does reddit fall under most often?

## Background
Reddit has grown incredibly popular in recent years, and it's not difficult to figure out why. The platform has evolved from being a basic social media platform into an extensive platform for data sources. My definition of data sources can include bright, cheerful, funny data or serious, deep, and dark data. This platform as proven its level of freedom when it comes to uncensored, explicit and wild content. It can undoubtedly be said that analyzing different aspects of Reddit is an interesting field of research. Our deep dive into this topic will give us valuable insight into the type of content available on Reddit, and whether it's mostly on the bright side or the dark side. Which side is it mostly used for?

## Data
Data will be primarily sourced from Reddit itself as well as data pulled from other platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Google, etc. It is most legitimate to use the data from reddit since the entire analysis is based on that specific platform. We can analyze the number of people using the subreddit platform to access basic information as well as dark content if we use the subreddit data. To support my research, I intend to use the most recent Reddit APIs to analyze these subreddits. Besides, I will refer to other papers and articles that contain relevant information as well.

## Method
This study uses 'Quantitative Content Analysis' as the research method.
Initially, a hypothesis based on the different sides of Reddit will be framed, followed by the identification of appropriate data from the above-mentioned sources that shows both the bright and dark sides of this platform. As part of this method, the choice of sample unit is also crucial, after which the coding schema is developed to test the hypothesis. We also code the Reddit data and test it to ensure it is reliable. After the data has been coded, we analyze it and note down the output results.
